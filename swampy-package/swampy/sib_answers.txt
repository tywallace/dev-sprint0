# Text answers from Week 0

# Name:



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:

The first line imports all of the functions from TurtleWorld
The second line creates a TurtleWorld assigned to world
The third line creates a Turtle assigned to bob
The fourth line tells TurtleWorld to wait for a user to do something.




These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: The arguments of polygon are t, n and length. T is a string of the name of the turle. N is an float  and length is an integer but could be a float.

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: I used the turtle functions fd and lt.

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: The arguments of polyline are turtle (a string), n the number of sides (an integer), length, the length of a side (a float) and angle, the angle of the corners (a float).





Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: the move function

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: You could call the arc function and tell it to go 360 degrees.

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: This type of requirement is a post condition.
